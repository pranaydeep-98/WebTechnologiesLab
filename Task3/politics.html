        <h2>Kolkata-bound Air India flight aborts take-off at Delhi airport due to technical snag.</h2>
        <p>An Air India spokesperson said Flight AI2403, operating from Delhi to Kolkata, was on the take-off roll when a technical issue was detected, leading the pilots to return to the taxiing bay.
          <br>
          An airport official said there were 160 passengers on board the Airbus 321 aircraft. The plane was scheduled to depart at around 7:30 pm but developed a technical problem. ‚ÄúThe flight promptly relayed the information (to air traffic control) and did not take off, moving back for taxiing,‚Äù said the official.

In a statement, Air India said, ‚ÄúFlight AI2403 operating from Delhi to Kolkata on 21 July 2025 has been rescheduled to depart later this evening, necessitated by a technical issue detected during the take-off roll. The cockpit crew decided to discontinue the take-off, following Standard Operating Procedures‚Äù.
